The button to go to the next / previous frame has the customization possibility.
To customize, right-click on the button and select one of three options:

1. The default option - go to the next / previous frame (the step is 1 frame).
2. Go to the next / previous frame that has any objects (in particular filtered).
   Read the [filter](/docs/manual/advanced/filter/) section to know the details how to use it.
3. Go to the next / previous frame without annotation at all.
   Use this option in cases when you need to find missed frames quickly.

Shortcuts: `D` - previous, `F` - next.
